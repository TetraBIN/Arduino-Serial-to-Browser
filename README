Uses bottle.py to set up the local server

browser_vis_serial.py reads in the arduino data, sends it through http.  bottle
converts python dicts into JSON. 

Also feeds in the index.html


index.html - javascript to get the serial data and display it. 

simple_serial - the arduino script, just reads from one of the analog pins
